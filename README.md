## About
These are my solutions for the course [CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/), which I took in 2023. Each solution scored 100%, according to check50's opinion. 

From the official description on the course website: 
> Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. To get a certificate, the student has to submit 9 problem sets plus a capstone project.

Instructor: David J. Malan.
